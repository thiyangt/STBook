This allows analysts to study both within-unit dynamics (how a given unit changes over time) and between-unit differences.\nIn finance and econometric modelling, panel data is widely used because it captures both the cross-sectional dimension (different firms, individuals, or markets) and the time dimension (repeated observations).\nIn Panel data and Longitudinal data, which combines cross-sectional and time-series data, allows for the examination of both “within-behavior” and “between-behavior” effects.\nExample (Country-level Panel Data)\nSuppose you collect data on GDP growth rates for 50 countries from 2000–2020.\n1. Country-specific behavior (within a country over time)\nYou can see how Sri Lanka’s GDP growth changed year by year.\nExample:\n\nwas there a slowdown after the 2008 global crisis, followed by recovery?\n\n2. cross-country and temporal effects (Between countries over time)\nYou can compare trends across countries.\nExample:\n\nDid most countries experience a dip in 2008–2009 due to the financial crisis?\nDo developing countries generally grow faster than developed countries over these 20 years?",
