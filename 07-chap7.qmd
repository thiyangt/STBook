## Spatial Continuity

Spatial continuity is a concept commonly used in geostatistics, spatial analysis, and environmental sciences. It describes how similar or related the values of a variable are at locations that are close to each other in space. Essentially, it measures the degree to which nearby locations resemble each other.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

Intuitive Explanation

If a variable (e.g., soil pH, temperature, rainfall, or pollutant concentration) changes gradually over space, then it has high spatial continuity.

If it changes abruptly or seems random from one location to another, it has low spatial continuity.

Formal Concept

Spatial continuity is often modeled using covariance or semivariogram functions in geostatistics.

The semivariogram quantifies how the similarity between measurements decreases as the distance between them increases.
