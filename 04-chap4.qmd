# Forecasting with Linear Time Series Models

## Autoregressive Models

$Y_t = \alpha + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p Y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t$

Where:

$Y_t$ is the value at time $t$

$\alpha$ is a constant,

$\phi_1, \phi_2,...\phi_p$ are the parameters,

$\epsilon_t$ is white noise (error term),

$p$ is the order of the AR model.
